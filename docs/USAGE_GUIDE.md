## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avantikaar246/Pet-Adoption-System.git
````

2. Open the project in your Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
3. Ensure all CSV files (if used) are in the project root or `resources/`.
4. Run `Main.java` to start the application.

## Main Workflow

1. **Add Pets / Adopters / Foster Homes** – Enter details using prompts.
2. **Submit Adoption Applications** – Adopters can apply for pets.
3. **Compatibility Matching** – The system calculates compatibility scores.
4. **Review Applications** – Approve or reject applications.
5. **Logs** – All actions are saved in `application_log.csv`.

## Notes

* CSV files store data persistently.
* Errors and invalid inputs will trigger custom exceptions.
* Follow the console prompts carefully for smooth execution.
