# Pet Adoption System – Limitations

1. **Console-Based Interface** – No GUI yet; all interactions happen via console.  
2. **CSV Storage** – Large datasets may slow down performance; no database integration yet.  
3. **No Authentication** – Any user can perform all actions; no admin or role-based access.  
4. **Limited Validation** – Only basic input validation is implemented.  
5. **Static Compatibility Logic** – Matching algorithm uses fixed weights; not customizable by users.  
6. **Reporting** – No advanced analytics or reports beyond CSV logs.
